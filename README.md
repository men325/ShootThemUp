## üéÆ Key Features

### Core Mechanics
- **Character Movement**: Movement component, jumping, sprinting and movement animations.  
- **Character Health System**: Damage handling, health regeneration, and death animations.  
- **Weapons System**: Base and inherited weapon classes with animations for reloading, aiming, and switching.  
- **Pickups**: Health and ammo pickups with unique animations and logic for interactions.

### Visuals and Effects
- **UMG Interface**: Widgets for health, ammo, and spectator modes.  
- **VFX with Niagara**: Dynamic effects for explosions, bullet trails, and environmental impact.
